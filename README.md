## ðŸ–Œ What is this?

This is a simplified version of the JavaScript code I use for a sketch guessing multiplayer game ~~I'm working on~~ I used to work on. Keep in mind that it's ~~still under development as I'm experimenting with different ways to build this. Still, this could be a nice start for similar projects~~ a very bare-bones version, which is only useful as a starting point for your own projects.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Include Socket.io in your client-side code

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/2.2.0/socket.io.js"
            integrity="sha256-yr4fRk/GU1ehYJPAs8P4JlTgu0Hdsp4ZKrx8bDEDC3I="
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    ```
    
2. Include this library in your client-side code

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/over-engineer/Socket.io-whiteboard@1.1.1/lib/whiteboard.js"
            integrity="sha384-RceltRoqS8zq7xl4btt0biBpy99d2+11CCTBAmBgfTkXshR6iIr5Lap4tXBA/lnh"
            crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    ```

3. Create a Whiteboard instance using `new Whiteboard()`, passing your canvas, your socket and optionally a default color and thickness.

    For example:

    ```javascript
    const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
    const whiteboard = new Whiteboard(canvas, socket);
    ```
    
4. For the server-side, check the `/demo/backend` directory

## ðŸ“š Documentation

The [demo](https://socketio-whiteboard.herokuapp.com/) has the bare minimum functionality to keep it as simple as possible.

In a real-world scenario you would have to customize the color, the thickness of the line, download drawings etc

These are the public methods you'll find in the `/lib/whiteboard.js` file:

| Method                                | Explanation                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whiteboard.color = newValue`         | Sets the line color to the given value                                        |
| `whiteboard.color`                    | Returns the current color of the line                                         |
| `whiteboard.thickness = newValue`     | Sets the line thickness to the given value                                    |
| `whiteboard.thickness`                | Returns the current thickness of the line                                     |
| `whiteboard.increaseThickness(step)`  | Increases the thickness of the line by the given step                         |
| `whiteboard.decreaseThickness(step)`  | Decreases the thickness of the line by the given step                         |
| `whiteboard.download(filename)`       | Exports the canvas drawing as an image file and saves it with the given name  |
| `whiteboard.clear()`                  | Clears the entire canvas                                                      |

In the above table `whiteboard` is an instance of `Whiteboard`
